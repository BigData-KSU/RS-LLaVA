## RS-Instructions Dataset

</p>

The **RS-instructions** dataset is created by combining four captioning and VQA datasets. Specifically, it includes two captioning datasets, [UCM-caption](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1mjPToHq#list/path=%2F) and UAV, as well as two VQA datasets, [RSVQA-LR](https://rsvqa.sylvainlobry.com/), and [RSIVQA-DOTA](https://github.com/spectralpublic/RSIVQA). We have utilized the same training and testing split as the original datasets. As a result, the **RS-instructions** dataset consists of 7,058 samples, with 5,506 samples in the training set and 1,552 samples in the test set.

The VQA datasets have been formatted in a conversational format. On the other hand, the captioning datasets have been transformed into an instruction-answer format using a set of instructions that simply ask for a description of the image, such as "Provide a description of the image" and "What does this image represent?".
